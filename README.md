The repository consists of all the tasks as a part of my Internship at Info aidTech.

The Credit Card Fraud Detection System:

This project has led me to design and train two robust models ‚Äì the Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier.

üîç The results have been extraordinary:

Logistic Regression Model Accuracy: 99.82%
Random Forest Classifier Model Accuracy: 99.95%

With dedication and precision, I harnessed the power of machine learning to create models that can discern even the faintest anomalies, ensuring the security of credit card transactions. The exceptional accuracy achieved underscores the significance of data-driven insights in preserving financial well-being.

This project has not only fortified my technical prowess but also deepened my commitment to ensuring the reliability of financial systems. As the curtains fall on this chapter, I'm exhilarated by the impact these efforts can have in fortifying the digital realm.

Iris Classification:

In this project, we embarked on a captivating journey into the realm of data classification using the Iris flower dataset. Leveraging the power of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier, we achieved remarkable accuracy rates:

KNN Model Accuracy: 92.11%
Random Forest Classifier Accuracy: 89.47%
Support Vector Classifier Accuracy: 94.73%
Each model demonstrated its unique strengths, contributing to the precision and reliability of our predictions. This project not only deepened our understanding of classification techniques but also unveiled the potential of data-driven insights in deciphering the world of flora. üåøüå∏

Movies Recommendation System:

My journey through the realm of movie recommendation has been an exhilarating ride, culminating in a robust and efficient system powered by the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) method. With dedication and precision, I have achieved an impressive accuracy of 93.33%, a testament to the effectiveness of our approach.

By harnessing the intricacies of data and employing KNN's proximity-based algorithm, we have paved the way for precise and personalized movie suggestions. This project not only underscores the power of machine learning in enhancing user experiences but also fuels our passion for innovation in the world of entertainment.
